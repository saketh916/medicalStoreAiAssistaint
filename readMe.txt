""""""
✅ Step 1: Check if the Given Medicine is Available in Store
Store member enters the medicine name from the prescription.
System searches the store’s database (MongoDB / MySQL) for that exact medicine.
If available, show:
Stock count
Price
Brand Name
Dosage instructions
Food interaction & safety warnings
If not available, move to Step 2.
✅ Step 2: AI Finds Alternative Medicines (Only if Step 1 Fails)
AI extracts the active formula of the unavailable medicine.
System searches for alternative brands with the same formula in the store’s database.
Example: If Dolo 650 is unavailable, AI finds Calpol 650, Medomol 650, etc.
Show the best available alternative (closest match, cheapest, or most stocked).
✅ Step 3: Display Alerts & Safety Warnings
Dosage Instructions – (e.g., "Take every 6 hours, max 4/day.")
Food Interaction Warnings – (e.g., "Take after food.")
Combination Safety Alerts – (e.g., "Avoid with Ibuprofen.")
Side Effects Alert – (e.g., "May cause drowsiness, avoid driving.")

📌 Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Week 1)
🔹 Define Requirements
✅ What data should be stored? (Medicine name, formula, price, stock, etc.)
✅ What features should the store member see? (Stock check, alternatives, safety alerts, etc.)

🔹 Choose Tech Stack
✅ Frontend: React.js (for UI)
✅ Backend: Node.js + Express (for API)
✅ Database: MongoDB (for medicine storage)
✅ AI Model: SciSpacy / OpenFDA API (for alternative medicine search)

🔹 Set Up Project
✅ Initialize backend with Express.js
✅ Connect MongoDB for medicine storage

📌 Phase 2: Backend & Database Development (Week 2-3)
🔹 🛠️ Build Database Schema (MongoDB)
✅ Medicine Name, Active Formula, Stock, Price, Brand, Dosage, Warnings

🔹 📡 Develop API Endpoints
✅ Check Medicine Availability (Search in DB)
✅ Find Alternatives (Based on active formula)
✅ Fetch Dosage Instructions & Warnings

🔹 ⚙️ Test API with Postman
✅ Ensure correct medicine data is retrieved
✅ Test alternative medicine search

📌 Phase 3: AI Integration for Alternative Medicine (Week 4-5)
🔹 🔍 Implement AI to Find Substitutes
✅ Use SciSpacy to extract formulas from medicine names
✅ Search DB for medicines with the same formula
✅ Rank results based on availability & price

🔹 💡 Improve Accuracy
✅ Fine-tune AI model for better alternative recommendations
✅ Add user feedback to improve medicine suggestions

📌 Phase 4: Frontend UI Development (Week 6-7)
🔹 🎨 Build UI in React.js
✅ Search bar for entering medicine name
✅ Results section showing medicine availability
✅ Alternative medicine suggestions (if main medicine is unavailable)
✅ Safety alerts and dosage instructions

🔹 🔗 Connect Frontend with Backend
✅ Call API to check medicine availability
✅ Display alternatives from AI-based search

📌 Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Week 8-9)
🔹 🛠️ Full System Testing
✅ Test with real medicine data
✅ Ensure AI provides relevant alternatives
✅ Fix UI/UX issues

🔹 🚀 Deploy Project for Demo
✅ Frontend: Host on Vercel / Render
✅ Backend: Deploy on Render
✅ Database: Use MongoDB Atlas

📌 Phase 6: Demo & Pitch (Week 10)
🔹 📊 Prepare a Demo for Medical Shops (Apollo, MedPlus, etc.)
✅ Create a simple pitch deck (Problem → Solution → Benefits)
✅ Show how the system works in real-time
✅ Get feedback from pharmacy owners & improve

🔥 Final Outcome:
✅ A working AI-powered medical store assistant system
✅ Tested with real medicine data
✅ Ready to be shown to Apollo, MedPlus, etc.
